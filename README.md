## Don't forget to give a :star: to make the project popular.

## :question: What is this Repository about?

- This repo contains example code of taking **Screenshots in Python**, including an automated test case using Selenium Webdriver on LambdaTest Cloud platform.
- This project uses Pytest framework to run the tests.

## :question: More about screenshots...
In the software testing landscape, screenshots are similar to 'visual documentation'. They confirm that a software's visuals align with its expected design, ensuring graphical elements are rendered appropriately and are devoid of flaws. In the context of test automation, their significance is magnified. 


## Running the Code

To run any of the scripts from command line use the following command in the correct folder:
```bash
python pyautogui-entire-screen.py
```

## Running the Cloud Grid Sample

By default, the test would be running on LambdaTest Platform on Chrome and Firefox Browsers, and on Windows 11 and MacOS.

As a prerequisite for this code, you need:
1. Download and Install Python

2. Download and Install Visual Studio Code

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code

4. Enter in the cloud-grid folder
```bash
cd cloud-grid
```

5. Install pytest, and Selenium WebDriver libraries
